# DASH-streaming-setup
Setup used for the video streaming experiments in the MMSys'20 Paper "Comparing Fixed and Variable Segment Durations for Adaptive Video Streaming â€“ A Holistic Analysis". 
## Overview 
The setup consists of three virtual machines. 
   * The __server__, which hosts the video content 
   * The __netem__, which throttles the bandwidth, as for example defined by traces 
   * The __client__, which uses DASH.js to stream the video

## Using the setup for video streaming measurements 
__Step 1__ Open a terminal and navigate into the subfolder *vagrant_files*. Run the following command to provision all VMs (this might take a few minutes).
```
vagrant up
```
All VMs are ready as soon as you can see the following
