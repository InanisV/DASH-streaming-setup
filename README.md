# DASH-streaming-setup
Setup used for the video streaming experiments in the MMSys'20 Paper "Comparing Fixed and Variable Segment Durations for Adaptive Video Streaming â€“ A Holistic Analysis". 
## Overview 
The setup consists of three virtual machines. 
   * The __server__, which hosts the video content 
   * The __netem__, which throttles the bandwidth, as for example defined by traces 
   * The __client__, which uses DASH.js to stream the video

## Using the setup for video streaming measurements 
__Step 1__ Open a terminal and navigate into the subfolder *vagrant_files*. Run the following command to provision all VMs (this might take a few minutes).
```
vagrant up
```
All VMs are ready as soon as you can see the following output: 
```
[nodemon] npm started
```

__Step 2__ Open a second terminal, navigate again into the subfolder *vagrant_files* and run the following commands to start the measurements. 
```
bash experiment_startup.sh
```
__Step 3__ As soon as a measurment run is finished, the log files can be found in the following directory: *DASH-setup/client/logs*

## Detailed description of the functionalities

### Client

### Netem 

### Server 

## Customizing the setup 
  * Using own video: 
  * Changing the heuristic
  * Own traces 
  * Using a fixed bandwidth


## Evaluating QoE from Log Files 

## Links/References
  * The measurements are performed using the DASH reference client implementation DASH.js https://github.com/Dash-Industry-Forum/dash.js?
